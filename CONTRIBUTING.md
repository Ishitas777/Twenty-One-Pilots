## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repo and work on **one module at a time** You are free to pick any module of your choice from the Github issues section.
2. Follow the **README inside each module folder** for detailed instructions.
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with:
   - `rtl.sv` (module implementation)
   - `tb.sv` (testbench)
   - Waveform screenshot showing correctness
4. PRs will be **manually reviewed**. Incomplete submissions may be closed.

All contribution details are provided in each module's `README.md`.

Please work on one module at a time and follow that module's README for submission requirements (for example: `rtl.sv`, `tb.sv`, and a waveform or simulator log). Open an issue or PR and clearly name the target module.

Thank you for contributing.
